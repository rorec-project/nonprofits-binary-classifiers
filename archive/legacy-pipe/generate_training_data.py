Use these definitions, which reflect experiences of scholars of economics of religion:

- Label 1 (RELIGIOUS) if:
  - The mission mentions religion, faith, God, Christ, Jesus, Bible, gospel, church, ministry, spiritual worship, or similar concepts; OR
  - The mission emphasizes positive community, compassion, hope, moral uplift, or similar concepts
    in a way typical of faith-based charities. Examples: "positive community", "give hope to the poor", "serve our neighbors",
    "acts of compassion", "uplift our community", etc.

- Label 0 (NON-RELIGIOUS) if:
  - The mission clearly focuses on secular activities (healthcare, sports, arts, environment, economic development,
    education, fairs, libraries, recreation, etc.) and does not show an obviously religious or faith-based motivation.

Examples (mission → label):

- "positive community" → 1
- "Christian worship to create positive community impact" → 1
- "religious services" → 1
- "under our faith in god" → 1
- "to provide soccer instruction to hanover township youth" → 0
- "operate rural public library" → 0
- "the bangor symphony orchestra provides powerful enriching and diverse musical experiences" → 0

Now classify the following mission:
